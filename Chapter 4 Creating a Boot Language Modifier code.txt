Chapter 4: Creating a "Boot Language Modifier" code
You might have already noticed that miscellaneous PAL games don't have a language select menu.
If you have a japanese or american BIOS, then you are stuck with the english language.
Therefore load your game's ELF into PS2DIS.
Search for
"JAL PatchIsNeeded"
and/or
"JAL SceScfGetLanguage".
Most likely there is only one reference per game.
Make a patch like this:
//Boot Language Modifier (use only one of these)
//Japanese
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020000
//English
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020001
//French
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020002
//Spanish
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020003
//German
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020004
//Italian
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020005
//Dutch
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020006
//Portuguese
//patch=0,EE,XXXXXXXX,word,24020007
Activate your favourite language by deleting the slashes.
If you select a language that wasn't programmed into the game, it will fall back to english.


P.S.
You can use this code also with your favorite cheat device and a real PS2.
Make a code like this:
Boot Language Modifier (use only one of these):
Japanese
2XXXXXXX 24020000
English
2XXXXXXX 24020001
French
2XXXXXXX 24020002
Spanish
2XXXXXXX 24020003
German
2XXXXXXX 24020004
Italian
2XXXXXXX 24020005
Dutch
2XXXXXXX 24020006
Portuguese
2XXXXXXX 24020007
You can use raw hex codes with Codebreaker, Xploder, X-Terminator and Madcatz Gameshark V3.
Datel Action Replay and Interact Gameshark V1-V2 require the code to be encrypted.
Don't ask me or anybody at pcsx2.net about that. Thanks in advance.
