Chapter 5: Brute Force Patch At "Return Address"
If you have loaded a game and there is no progress at some point, then stop the game and enter debugger.
Remember the addresses PC (program counter) and RA (return address).
Continue the game and stop it again.
If the PC and RA are the same as before, then there must be sth. in the current routine that is not yet properly emulated.
Subtract 8 from RA and check if it is a jump command. Most likely it should be.
Quit emulator, make a patch that replaces the jump command with a NOP and restart the game.
Maybe the game progresses further now, maybe not.
