Chapter 1: Creating a "skip videos" code - basic method
Credits to CMX and bongsan for the original idea ;-)

Load your game's ELF into PS2DIS.
Search the hex string:
4000838c0800e0030000628c
The disassembler should jump to:
sceMpegIsEnd:
lw	v1, $0040(a0)	 :8c830040
jr	ra		 :03e00008
lw	v0, $0000(v1)	 :8c620000
change the third line into:
addiu 	v0, zero, $0001  :24020001
Add a line into your patch file like this:
//Skip Videos
patch=0,EE,0xxxxxxx,word,24020001
If you have a game that has more than one ELF - e.g. the demo disc PBPX_955.06 (comes with your PS2) - then you should load the game's ISO file into a hex editor.

Search the hex string:
4000838c0800e0030000628c
and replace with:
4000838c0800e00301000224
You find that about a dozen times with demo disc PBPX_955.06

This method will not work with all games!

P.S.
You can use this code also with your favorite cheat device and a real PS2.
Make a code like this:
Skip Videos
2xxxxxxx 24020001
You can use raw hex codes with Codebreaker, Xploder, X-Terminator and Madcatz Gameshark V3.
Datel Action Replay and Interact Gameshark V1-V2 require the code to be encrypted.
Don't ask me or anybody at pcsx2.net about that. Thanks in advance.
