Chapter 3: Fixing GS_CSR
Download the demo "Jomommaz" from thethirdcreation.net
copy all files into the host folder
start the ELF with Gssoft - works fine
start the ELF with Gsmax or Gstaris - you see a black screen with high frame rate
stop the game and enter debugger
it will read EPC=00100438 - scroll up a little
0010042C 3C031200: lui	v1, 0x1200
00100430 34631000: ori	v1, v1, 0x1000
00100434 00000000: nop
00100438 DC620000: ld	v0, 0x0000(v1)
0010043C 30420008: andi	v0, v0, 0x0008
00100440 1040FFFD: beq	v0, zero, 0x00100438
The address $12001000 is the hardware register GS_CSR.
For some reason the bit test at 0010043C fails, so that it loops infinitely.
To break the loop you can either NOP the BEQ command or better change ANDI into ORI (just in case V0 is needed afterwards).
0010043C 34420008: ori	v0, v0, 0x0008
Therefore load JOMOMMAZ.ELF into your hex editor
go to offset $043c and replace "08 00 42 30 " with "08 00 42 34"
save as JOMOMMAZ-FIXED.ELF and try that with Gsmax or Gstaris
voila!


Go back to thethirdcreation.net and do the same with "CarShowroom".
