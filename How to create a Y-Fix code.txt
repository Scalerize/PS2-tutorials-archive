How to create a Y-Fix code
Credits to Leering7 for the original idea ;-)
Load your game's ELF into PS2DIS.
Go to function "sceGsSetDefDispEnv"
Search for:
26430032: addiu v1, s2, 0x0032
Replace with:
264300??: addiu v1, s2, 0x00??

Search for 19, 48 and 24 and do the same.

This method will not work with all games!
